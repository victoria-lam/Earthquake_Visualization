# Earthquake Visualization Using Leaflet

Data was gathered from the United States Geological Survey page from the updated [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) that mapped earthquakes that occurred within the last 7 days. Leaflet was used to visualize the latitude and longitude of each data point. The size and color of each point was determined by the magnitude of the recorded information.
